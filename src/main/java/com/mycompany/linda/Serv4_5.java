/*
 *The second server manages touple operations that have a length of 4-5
 * This exercise consists in creating a Coordonation Distributed system LINDA.
 *The system must include:
 *   * PostNote (PN)
 *   * RemoveNote (RN)
 *   * ReadNote (ReadN) 
 *A template will be a special touple type in which variables can appear, only 
 *with RN or ReadN operations.Example:
 * ["John","20","Maried"] is a simple 3 element touple
 * ["John","?X","?Y"] is a simple 3 element touple with 2 variables,"X" and "Y".
 *Internaly in every one of these servers the touples are stored in memory.
